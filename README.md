# Precision-Current-Adapter

PCB design for a precision current adapter. Based on the design provided by David L. Jones (EEVblog) [https://www.eevblog.com/projects/ucurrent/](https://www.notion.so/Projects-58f3c7389f1743e991f9e1c6f60725cf)

# Summary

This current adapter can measure current in the nano amperes scale, and also can measure current up to 300mA. One of its most valuable characteristics is its low power and high precision.
